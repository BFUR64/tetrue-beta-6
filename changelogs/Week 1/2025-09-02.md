[ Successes ]
- Fully reconfigured nvim from the ground up
- Fully moved to new package manager in nvim (pcker.nvim)
- Implemented About and Settings in Main Menu
- Generalized center text into a method
- I GOT THE GD AND GI TO FUCKING WORK LESGOOOO!!!!!!!!
    How? SIMPLE. I moved the initialization of the Java LSP
    from init.lua to ftplugins/java.lua. This folder lives
    alongside the lua folder and init.lua file! I didn't know
    this before but, turns out it's sort of a lazy loader to
    which launches the specific lua based on the name, like 
    java.lua launching when filetype is *.java.
