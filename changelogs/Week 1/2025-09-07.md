[ Successes ]
- I experimented with Generic types and Lambda for the first 
    time. It's mindboggling. 
- I made a generic SettingsItem class that can accept any 
    type 
- Added SettingRegistry class to register items in 
- Made a prototype settings menu that uses generics rather 
    than hardcoded code 
- 


[ Changed ]
- Changed getGridRow and getGridCol to getHeight and getWidth 
    respectively
- Decoupled the list from SettingItem to its own class, a 
    SettingRegistry 
- Commented out the  old handleSettings() method for now, I 
    am rewriting it completely 
- 


[ Difficulties ]
- Lambdas and Generics are weird. Really weird. I get the 
    gist of it though and was able to implement something 
    really cool cuz of it, though I have not finished yet 
- Lambdas are super fucking cool. GENERICS ARE SUPER 
    FUCKING COOL TOO 
- 


[ To-Do ]
- (x) Refactor the settings menu code
    - (/) Make it super abstract. Only calling a method to 
        add a new menu item 
    - 
- (x) Do a visual indicator like an underscore for the 
    settings menu to indicate that it's changeable
- (x) Do a visual indicator to indicate you are changing a 
    setting, like highlighting the word
- (x) Implement the backend of the settings menu 
-
