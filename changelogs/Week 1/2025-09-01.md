[ Successes ]
- I successfully setup maven
- I copied over the pom.xml from the previous version v5_1
- I added a release for the properties in pom.xml
- I added an LSP rename via <leader>r. Super OP
- Added docs via <leader>K


[ Changed ]
- Changed version from 0.0.2 -> 0.0.3 in pom.xml
- Attempting to switch away from Terminal to Screen Class of
    Lanterna


[ Difficulties ]
- I'm not sure if adding release in the properties in pom.xml is necessary
- Super fucking difficult to get gd and gi working

[ To-Do ]
- (/) Might need to reinstall nvim from the ground up using
    proper docs and not gpt
- (x) Fix gd and gi goto commands. IDK how.
