[ Successes ]
- 


[ Changed ]
- Changed SettingItem to support wildcard casting via the 
    method `setRawValue(Object value)` for runtime checking 
    with the original `setValue(T value)` for compile-time 
    checking
- Changed the ENTIRE main menu. It uses composition to build 
    the settings. Completely fucking dynamic 
- 


[ Difficulties ]
- My head hurts from all the composition and the dynamic 
    nature of my menu navigation system. I need a damn break 
- 


[ To-Do ]
- (x) Refactor the settings menu code
    - (/) Make it super abstract. Only calling a method to 
        add a new menu item 
    - 
- (x) Do a visual indicator like an underscore for the 
    settings menu to indicate that it's changeable
- (x) Do a visual indicator to indicate you are changing a 
    setting, like highlighting the word
- (x) Implement the backend of the settings menu 
-
