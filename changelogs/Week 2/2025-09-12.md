[ Successes ]
- Added line breaks 
- Added text drawing 
- Fixed edge cases with `MenuManager` due to the addition of 
    the `selectable` field 
- Fixed errors just disappearing cuz lanterna clears
    the screen 
- 


[ Changed ]
- Changed curPos to curIndex to be in-line with the Array 
    and prevent confusion with off-by-one errors. 
- (Reiterated) `selectionManager()` into `EditableItem` 
    class 
- Refactored `MenuContext.java` 
- Made a few variables final and static in `MenuManager` 
- Made a few fields final in `App.java` 
- Made a few fields final in `MenuManager` 
- Made a few fields finak in `Item` 
- Made `Actionable` throw Exception for future-proofing 
- Made `Item` `onSelect()` throw Exception to support 
    new `Actionable` behavior 
- Reverted the last two changes ^^^ the compiler did not 
    like me mixing IOException and Exception, causing an 
    unhandled Exception or something compilation error 
- 


[ Difficulties ]
- Surprisingly not difficult ever since I changed the 
    curPos to indexPos. That shit was previously confusing 
    to manage 
- 


[ To-Do ]
- (/) Support line breaks 
- (/) Support text drawing 
- (x) Refactor the settings menu code
    - (/) Make it super abstract. Only calling a method to 
        add a new menu item 
    - 
- (/) Refactor `selectionManager()` to something more 
    maintainable 
-
