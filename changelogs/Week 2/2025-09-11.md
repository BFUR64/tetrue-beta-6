[ Successes ]
- Improved validation in `Config`, now individual-based 
    rather than resetting everything if one config is found 
    invalid 
- Fixed printing issues in `MenuManager`, specifically when 
    the user inputs a valid number but sanitation disallows 
    it, the leftover values are still present, with the 
    default just overwriting what is there 
- Added a "Revert to Default" option in `Settings` 
- Added centerText so it shows what menu you are in 
- Added `MenuContext` abstraction to prevent myself from 
    passing 5000 parameters in the constructor classes of 
    the `Item` instances, e.g., `ActionItem` not really 
    needing it so I only type one parameter in and just 
    ignore it 
- Accidentally removed error.log implementation, so I use 
    `System.err.print()` instead. Hopefully it works well 
- 


[ Changed ]
- Deleted all magic values in `Config` and made them static 
    or named
- Put initialization of menuList into separate helper 
    methods e.g. `buildMainMenu()` and `buildSettingsMenu()` 
- Removed said helper method and added it to `SelectableItem` 
    class instead.
- Removed `Actions` class as it is now redundant due to new 
    structure of `MenuManager` 
- Dropped `selectionManager` a while ago. `SelectableItem` 
    now handles its responsibilities as a proper 
    implementation, generalized thanks to `MenuManager` 
- 


[ Difficulties ]
- Proper architecturing is difficult. I managed to do some 
    of it surprisingly. I'm starting to love my main menu 
    system that I built. 
- I thought I would be finished with the main menu since 
    2 days ago... Im wrong lol

[ To-Do ]
- (/) Re-add centerText 
- (x) Support line breaks 
- (x) Support text drawing 
- (x) Refactor the settings menu code
    - (/) Make it super abstract. Only calling a method to 
        add a new menu item 
    - 
- (x) Refactor `selectionManager()` to something more 
    maintainable 
- (REDUNDANT) Do a visual indicator like an underscore for 
    the settings menu to indicate that it's changeable
- (/) Do a visual indicator to indicate you are changing a 
    setting, like highlighting the word
- (/) Implement the backend of the settings menu 
-
