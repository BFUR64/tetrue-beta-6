[ Successes ]
- Added "[ DEBUG ]" in `Logging` 
- Added `writeLineBreak()` in `Logging` 
- Every setting change now auto writes to config file 
- 


[ Changed ]
- Changed a few INFO logs to DEBUG 
- Removed a few INFO logs 
- Refactored `Config` again 
- 


[ Difficulties ]
- Turns out Jackson uses setter and getter methods of your 
    program by default unless you explicitly tell it not to 
    :T (aka `setVisibility()`)
- 


[ To-Do ]
- (x) Start with the game already 
- (/) Fix `LogType`, why the brackets are not appearing in 
    the logs 
- (/) Make the saving of config intuitive. Save immediately 
    when the user types something valid rather than relying 
    on save ans return 
-
