[ Changed ]

- Reverted all sound-related changes 
- Readded sound under its own sub package `sound` with 
    the classes: `Sound`, `SoundData`, `SoundManager` 
- Changed static block in `SoundManager` to a static method 
    `initialize()` 
- Refactored `SoundManager` for DRY

- Fixed hard crash in `SoundManager` if all files are missing 
- Added safety null checks in `SoundManager` 
- Removed redundant warn logs in `SoundManager` 
- 


[ Difficulties ]
- The API is so fucking weird. Turns out it's low-level 
    meant for long audio streams, hence the seemingly 
    unnecessary amount of code to play a small audio file 
    reliably. Should be reliable moving forward though 
- `LogType` should have brackets [] e.g. [ WARN ] but for 
    some reason it's not present in the log file 
- 


[ To-Do ]
- (x) Start with the game already 
- (x) Fix `LogType`, why the brackets are not appearing in 
    the logs 
-
