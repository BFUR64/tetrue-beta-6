[ Successes ]
- Added inline user error for inputting raw values in 
    `EditableItem`, specifically where the user typed the 
    wrong value, the error appears in the same row 
- Added primitive sound system lol 
- 


[ Changed ]
- Simplified `App` slightly by removing redundant methods 
- Reduced code dup. in `MenuManager` 
- Used the RGB (255, 70, 70) "Red" for the error inline 
- 


[ Difficulties ]
- Weirdly specific bug where if I modify background color 
    it changes the entire background even though I put it 
    to default. I somehow fixed it. I dont know how. 
- ... Scratch that. I know how I fixed it. Use `Termunal` 
    1. `resetColorAndSGR()`
    2. `clearScreen()` 
    
    ... In that order. If you do 2 before 1, the bug appears.
    dont ask me how or why. I dont know man 
- The implementation for sound is so ass I'm removing it 
    by tomorrow :skull: 
- 


[ To-Do ]
- (x) Start with the game already 
- (/) Add error thing for when you input wrong value
