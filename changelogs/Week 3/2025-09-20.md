[ Successes ]
- Put the project in Github 
- Added git integration in neovim via gitsigns, diffview, 
    and neogit 
- Added `Block` and some ideas on immutability for 
    template usage 
- Added a test block OBlock 
-

[ Difficulties ]
- I realized now that my 2nd option in To-Do is kind of 
    stupid. It defears the idea of separation of concerns 
    if `Block` does not just store data, but also knows 
    how to rotate it and stuff, which does not make sense 
    in hindsight 
- 


[ To-Do ]
- (x) Start with the game already 
- (DEFUNCT) Try adding rotation in the Block itself 
    rather than a different method doing the 
    implementation 
- (x) Implement all the blocks of Tet*** in `Block` 
- (x) Implement return of the LinkedList as an 
    immutable instance via `List.of()` for true 
    immutability 
- (x) Implement copyBlock() in `Block` with parameter 
    "int index" so it knows which block in the List to 
    copy. Output will be Cell[][] 
- (x) Fix minor inconsistencies of how you use camelCase 
    and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE; Essentially, undo all the shit 
    you did where you turned public final v name to NAME 
    which is NOT supposed to be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
